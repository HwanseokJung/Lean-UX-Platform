The LEAN UX platform provides an innovative way of evaluating the User experience with the combined abilities of managing multi-modal, wide range of emotions, real-time synchronization, time spans based experience extraction, multi-device integration and powerful visualization. It objectifies the subjective nature of user in evaluating user experience through triangulation methods. UX experts are empowered through powerful real-time analytics visualization to get insight of time spans user experience.

As a core component of the above-mentioned LeanUX platform, we develop a facial expression recognizer with high accuracy by using deep learning algorithms. Particularly, the core technology is the learning of an efficient Dual Neural Network (Spatial Covolutional Neural Network + Temporal Recurrent Neural Network) for tightly comibining high-level facial expression features in spatiotemporal domains to efficiently detect the ultimate emotions.

The architecture of the FER component is manifested as follows
